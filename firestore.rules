/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for an e-commerce platform that balances public browsing with secure, role-based access for users and sellers.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is built on three primary access patterns:
 * 1. Public Read, Admin Write: Collections like 'products' are publicly browsable, but can only be modified by an authenticated user with an 'admin' custom claim.
 * 2. Strict User Ownership: User-specific data, such as personal information ('/users/{userId}') and AI recommendations, is strictly confined to the authenticated user who owns it.
 * 3. Shared Access: Collaborative documents like 'orders' and 'chats' are accessible only to the specific participants involved (e.g., the buyer and the seller).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into several top-level collections (/users, /sellers, /products, /orders, /chats) to segregate public, private, and shared data. User- and seller-specific data is nested in subcollections (e.g., /users/{userId}/aiRecommendations) to leverage path-based security.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Custom Claims for Roles: The 'admin' role is managed via Firebase Auth Custom Claims. The rule `request.auth.token.admin == true` is used to grant privileged access for product management.
 * - Denormalization for Security: Documents such as 'orders' and 'chatMessages' contain denormalized 'userId' and 'sellerId' fields. This is a deliberate design choice to enable fast, secure, and cost-effective authorization checks without needing extra database reads (`get` calls).
 * - Query-Based Listing: Listing all documents in the '/orders' collection is denied by default. Access is granted only through specific, secured queries where the client must filter by their own 'userId' or 'sellerId', preventing data leakage.
 * - Path-Based Chat Security: Access to chat messages is determined by the chat room's ID (e.g., '{userId}_{sellerId}'). This ensures that only the two participants can read or write to their conversation, providing strong isolation.
